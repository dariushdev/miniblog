# Miniblog

Minimalistic blog made with PHP

# Overview

One of my projects that I found in my archive. It was supposed to be a small, minimalistic blog with a commenting feature. Users could comment without needing to register, and the application has a dashboard where admins can write new articles. Although the project is not finished, I have implemented the main features.

# Why

I was developing this project to learn new things. First of all, I wanted to learn more about how MVC frameworks worked by developing one from scratch. Secondly, I aimed to expand my knowledge of dependency injection and various design patterns. Lastly, I hoped to improve my object-oriented programming skills.

# How to use

Clone git repository and run (inside root directory):

``php -S localhost:80``
